    "# Utilizing Agents + RAG to Generate Research Ideas\n",
    "### By: Bradley Sides\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Author inputs their 3(?) most recent papers.\n",
    "2. Related works are located using RAG with sentence embeddings.\n",
    "3. With special consideration placed on the author's own papers, augmented with background context from the related works in addition to the model's own knowledge, generate a \"baseline\" research idea for the author.\n",
    "4. Utilize harsh reviewing agents to assess the idea based on multiple criteria.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Novelty agent checks that the idea is sufficiently different from already researched topics. Provides detailed feedback as well as a score.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Fundability/Impact agent checks that the idea is both competitive for grants and focused on an important topic rather than simply something obscure. Provdes detailed feedback as well as a score.\n",
    "5. If score minimums are not met, return to idea generating agent with feedback from both reviewing agents to improve upon the idea, iterate until passing.\n",
    "6. Once score minimums are met, the idea is finalized.\n",

      "**Background:** Building upon the findings of Papers 1 and 2, this study explores the intersection of AI-generated content, peer review, and scientific communication. The increasing accessibility of AI-powered tools, as discussed in Paper 4, raises concerns about their potential misuse in scientific publishing. This study investigates the potential consequences of AI-generated content on the scientific process, focusing on author-suggested reviewers and figure quality in open-access publications.\n",

      "**Methodology:**\n",

      "1. **Data Collection:** Gather a large dataset of open-access publications from various fields, including neuroscience, and extract information on author-suggested reviewers, figure quality, and manuscript acceptance rates.\n",
      "2. **AI-generated Content Analysis:** Use AI-powered tools to analyze the language patterns and writing styles of author-suggested reviewers and figure captions. Compare the results with human-generated content to identify potential anomalies.\n",
      "3. **Peer Review Analysis:** Investigate the correlation between AI-generated content and peer-review outcomes, such as review scores, acceptance rates, and subjective review quality.\n",
      "4. **Figure Quality Analysis:** Assess the accessibility, readability, and explainability of figures in publications with AI-generated captions, comparing them to human-generated captions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Research Questions:**\n",
      "\n",

    "abstract_1 = \"### PAPER 1: Peer review is an important part of science, aimed at providing expert and objective assess- ment of a manuscript. Because of many factors, including time constraints, unique expertise needs, and deference, many journals ask authors to suggest peer reviewers for their own manuscript. Previous researchers have found differing effects about this practice that might be inconclusive due to sample sizes. In this article, we analyze the association between author-suggested reviewers and review invitation, review scores, acceptance rates, and subjective review quality using a large dataset of close to 8K manuscripts from 46K authors and 21K reviewers from the journal PLOS ONE’s Neuroscience section. We found that all- author-suggested review panels increase the chances of acceptance by 20 percent points vs all-editor-suggested panels while agreeing to review less often. While PLOS ONE has since ended the practice of asking for suggested reviewers, many others still use them and perhaps should consider the results presented here.\"\n",
    "abstract_2 = \"### PAPER 2: Figures are an essential part of scientific communication. Yet little is understood about how accessible (e.g., color-blind safe), readable (e.g., good contrast), and explainable (e.g., contain captions and legends) they are. We develop computational techniques to measure these features and analyze a large sample of them from open access publications. Our method combines computer and human vision research principles, achieving high accuracy in detecting problems. In our sample, we estimated that around 20.6% of publications contain either accessibility, readability, or explainability issues (around 2% of all figures contain accessibility issues, 3% of diagnostic figures contain readability issues, and 23% of line charts contain explainability issues). We release our analysis as a dataset and methods for further examination by the scientific community.\"\n",
    "abstract_3 = \"### PAPER 3: Research has shown that most resources shared in articles (e.g., URLs to code or data) are not kept up to date and mostly disappear from the web after some years (Zeng et al., 2019). Little is known about the factors that differentiate and predict the longevity of these resources. This article explores a range of explanatory features related to the publication venue, authors, references, and where the resource is shared. We analyze an extensive repository of publications and, through web archival services, reconstruct how they looked at different time points. We discover that the most important factors are related to where and how the resource is shared, and surprisingly little is explained by the author’s reputation or prestige of the journal. By examining the places where long-lasting resources are shared, we suggest that it is critical to disseminate and create standards with modern technologies. Finally, we discuss implications for reproducibility and recognizing scientific datasets as first-class citizens.\"\n",

This can pose serious threat to the credibility of various forms of media if these technologies are used for plagiarism, including scientific literature and news sources. Despite the development of automated methods for paraphrase identification, detecting this type of plagiarism remains a challenge due to the disparate nature of the datasets on which these methods are trained. In this study, we review traditional and current approaches to paraphrase identification and propose a refined typology of paraphrases. We also investigate how this typology is represented in popular datasets and how under-representation of certain types of paraphrases impacts detection capabilities. Finally, we outline new directions for future research and datasets in the pursuit of more effective paraphrase detection using AI.\"\n",
